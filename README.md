Cat House — Tailwind Grid Layout Playground Find your layout purr-fection A
playful layout experiment with CSS Grid and TailwindCSS.

📝 Project Description This project is a frontend layout playground called Cat
House, showcasing the use of modern CSS Grid techniques in combination with
TailwindCSS utility classes. The layout is responsive, semantic, and built to
demonstrate advanced grid usage such as:

grid-template-areas

minmax(), auto-fit, auto-fill

nested grids

(optionally) subgrid structure

This is not a full app, but a layout concept — useful for learning, design
prototyping, or integrating into larger projects.

🚀 Technologies Used ⚡️ Vite as the bundler

⚛️ React for component-based UI

💨 TailwindCSS for utility-first styling

🎨 CSS Grid for layout structure

✅ Deployed with Vercel

📄 Pages Overview Main Layout Page — a responsive grid layout that adapts across
screen sizes

Example blocks include:

Navigation/Header

Main content zone

Sidebar blocks

Footer

The grid layout is built using semantic HTML + grid-area names in TailwindCSS

🧭 Routing No complex routing is used — this is a static layout with a single
page. Future enhancements may include routing examples or layout variants.

🧠 State Management No global state — this is a static layout demo. If needed,
local state or animations could be added.

⚙️ Functional Highlights 📐 Uses grid-template-areas in Tailwind via @layer
utilities

🧩 Responsive behavior built using Tailwind breakpoints

🖼️ Placeholder images / content blocks simulate real UI

🧪 Good for layout prototyping or onboarding junior devs with CSS Grid

🎨 Design Fully responsive using Tailwind’s mobile-first approach

Custom grid naming via Tailwind’s @layer extension

Clean, minimalistic visual style (modular, component-based)
